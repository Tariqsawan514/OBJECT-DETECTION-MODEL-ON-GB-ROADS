# OBJECT-DETECTION-MODEL-ON-GB-ROADS
This repository presents a deep learning model, specifically utilizing the YOLOv8 architecture, trained on a dataset of road images captured in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The primary goal of this model is to enhance road safety by accurately detecting and classifying various objects within these images, including vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs.

The YOLOv8 model is renowned for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. By training this model on a dataset tailored to the specific challenges of Gilgit-Baltistan's road conditions, such as diverse lighting conditions, varying road surfaces, and complex traffic patterns, the model aims to achieve high performance in real-world scenarios.

The potential applications of this model are numerous. In the realm of autonomous vehicle navigation, the model can provide crucial information about the surrounding environment, enabling vehicles to make informed decisions and avoid potential hazards. Additionally, the model can be integrated into traffic monitoring systems to analyze traffic flow, identify traffic violations, and optimize traffic management strategies.
